Listed below is a short summary of all the Animonculory modlists, and what mods you should familiarize yourself with prior to playing the game.

### [Animonculory Dev Tools](https://github.com/The-Animonculory/ADT/blob/main/README.md)

Designed as the mod author's tool kit, Animonculory Dev Tools (ADT) comes with all the tools you need to create and test your mods. Featuring mandatory DLL level fixes & libraries to build your own with, **native GOG and Steam compatability** and a few tweaks, it's the ideal playground to both work and build on.

### [Animonculory Visual Overhaul](https://github.com/The-Animonculory/Animonculory-Visual-Overhaul)

Featuring graphical enhancements, mandatory bug fixes and tweaks and method patching, Animonculory Visual Overhaul (AVO) is the perfect base to build your modlist on. AVO is made for Skyrim Special Edition **Version 1.6.640/659** (also known as Anniversary Edition) and uses the .exe of that version as well. It uses [Solas Weathers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49004) by default; however, it can support whichever weather mod you wish to use.

### [Do Not Go Gentle](https://github.com/Arkay-1248/Do-Not-Go-Gentle)

Do Not Go Gentle started off as a personal list that was built off of AVO-AE with Requiem. Eventually, I liked what I had built enough to share with others. You'll see a different choice of followers than the usual, quest additions, vanilla quest tweaks/enhancements, a full combat overhaul, a religion overhaul, along with npc replacers, a full visual overhaul based on AVO-AE, and lots of character customization options.

This list is designed as Requiem modlist with [Bruma](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10917), [Wyrmstooth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45565), [VIGILANT](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11849), and lots of other additions to extend the life of your character playthrough. I did not build this to be a painful list to play, but Requiem does make you plan out your actions more than vanilla Skyrim. I find my build to be a reasonable balance between difficulty and enjoyment, and maybe you will too.

### [Krahven](https://sites.google.com/view/krahven/krahven-main-page)
Have you ever launched Skyrim and wished you could play as any other character except the Dragonborn of Legend? Do you appreciate friendly survival mechanics, classic RPG elements, and discovering the strengths and weaknesses of opponents to better tackle the new challenges they present? Are you a fan of playing as a Khajiit?

If you answered "yes" to any of the above, then Krahven might be the list for you.
