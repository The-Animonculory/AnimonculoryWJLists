Listed below is a short summary of all the Animonculory modlists, and what mods you should familiarize yourself with prior to playing the game.

***

### [Al/Styyx Setup of Skyrim - ASSOS](https://github.com/The-Animonculory/ASSOS)

> *Get Started with your modlist without setting up the basic bug fixes and frameworks yourself.*

**Al and Styyx's Setup of Skyrim (ASSOS)** is designed to serve as a base to build off. You'll find all the required bug-fixes and frameworks present, with a few other items to help facilitate your list building. 

Whilst it is not designed for you to play the game with, it'll be stable enough to do so with. There's other lists probably more suited to that though.

### [Aurora](https://github.com/The-Animonculory/Aurora) - CARETAKER ONLY

*Aurora is a visuals-only Wabbajack list for Skyrim Special Edition with emphasis on consistency. Based on Skyrim Modding Essentials.*

### [Cursadelica](https://github.com/The-Animonculory/Curseadelica)

A modlist that is based around a desire to prepare a feast for the eyes, to always give them something interesting to look at.

It uses Simonrim and Legacy of the Dragonborn.

It has approximately 20,000 interesting things to explore, summon, fight, find.

That is all you need to know.

### [Styyx Tooling For Dev](https://github.com/Styyx1/ADT)

Designed to be the mod author’s tool kit, **Styyx’s Tooling for Dev (STD)** comes with everything you need to create and test your mods. Featuring mandatory engine fixes, DLL libraries to build plugins with, a fully patched Creation Kit and modding libraries, it’s the ideal playground to build and work on.

This list is not designed for building a modlist with. We recommend using **Al and Styyx's Setup of Skyrim (ASSOS)** which can be found [here](https://github.com/The-Animonculory/ASSOS).

STD uses SkyrimSE executable version **1.6.1170**, but **does not require** the paid update to the game.
