### [Cursadelica](https://github.com/The-Animonculory/Curseadelica)

A modlist that is based around a desire to prepare a feast for the eyes, to always give them something interesting to look at.

It uses Simonrim and Legacy of the Dragonborn.

It has approximately 20,000 interesting things to explore, summon, fight, find.

That is all you need to know.

### [Styyx Tooling For Dev](https://github.com/Styyx1/ADT)

Designed to be the mod author's tool kit, Styyx Tooling for Dev comes with everything you need to create and test your mods. Featuring mandatory engine fixes, DLL libaries to build plugins with, a fully patched creation kit and modding libraries, it's the ideal playground to both work and build on. If you are led to the list thinking it's an ideal base to build your own modlist with, you've been misled, while it can be used for that, it's probably not what you want.

And to prevent any confusion, STD does use the version 1.6.1170 of Skyrim.
